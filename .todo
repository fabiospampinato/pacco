Now:
  ☐ check all `//FIXME` and `//TODO`
  ☐ Make the code cross-platform
  ☐ Test on Windows
  ☐ Maybe rename `@before` to something else, since it has a different meaning than in `foo.before.js`
  ☐ Do we support `@after` already? we should, for consistency
  ☐ We should support `@override`
  ☐ bump version to 1.0.0

Next:
  ☐ add verbose and very verbose flags, for extra output, useful during debugging
  ☐ replace redundant names with index (tab/tab.scss => tab/index.scss) @high
    ☐ allow implicit befores/requires (@require tab/tab.scss => @require tab/index.scss => @require tab)
    ☐ should `variables.scss` be inferred too?
  ☐ Add support for importing node modules @high
  ☐ adding `@require`s to extenders (.before, .after) doesn't work, since they get moved after... maybe we should move left or right the one more to the left in the dependencies list instead... @high

Future:
  ☐ Migrate code to TypeScript
  ☐ Add TypeScript compilation support
  ☐ Maybe add patch files that patch single lines, like `foo.patch.js` (quite ugly and not future proof)
