Now:
  ☐ benchmark Svelto compilation
    ☐ faster SCSS compilation using temp files

Next:
  ☐ Test on Windows
    ☐ bump version and publish

Future:
  ☐ Migrate code to TypeScript
  Support file formats:
    ☐ Typescript (https://github.com/ivogabe/gulp-typescript)

Maybe:
  ☐ Switch to https://github.com/MatAtBread/fast-async (it's supposed to be faster)
  ☐ Support nested suffixes: `*.suffix.suffix.js`
  ☐ Publish plugins
  ☐ Add patch files that patch single lines, like `foo.patch.js` (quite ugly and not future proof)
  ☐ Replace redundant names with index (tab/tab.scss => tab/index.scss)
    ☐ allow implicit befores/requires (@require tab/tab.scss => @require tab/index.scss => @require tab)
    ☐ should `variables.scss` be inferred too?
